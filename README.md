# Blockchains and Python

Nothing magnificent here, just trying to repeat what I read in a medium article about blockchains. Go, read it at [Learn blockchains by building one](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)

I don't know you but I learn code writing code, go write yours!


The proof algorithm is easy, the has of the concatenation of our proof and previous proof should finish in 4 zeroes

hash('previous' + 'proof')[-4] == '0000'

Easy to proof, difficult to calculate!
